# Kickstarting with Excel

## Kickstarter Analysis

### Overview of Project

 To analyze data to find correlations between the launch dates and success, and the goal amount and success. This data can be used to plan future kickstarter programs. The data was filtered down to plays and theater projects.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

![Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch](../Desktop/Classwork/Crowdfunding%20Analysis/Resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png)

The most successful kickstarter campaigns were launched in the Spring through Summer. The graph shows the highest spike in May with then slowly decreases to August which matches the amount successful in April.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

![Outcomes_vs_Goals](../Desktop/Classwork/Crowdfunding%20Analysis/Resources/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png)

The most successful kickstarter campaign goals were under $5,000 and between $35,000 and $45,000. There is a severe spike in both directions when increasing over $45,000.


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

I encountered formatting difficulties, gettting the x axis to read the percentages correctly. My excel defaulted with the x and y axis flipped so I toggled through until I got the graph set in a way that made the most sense for what I was looking for. The data also showed "blanks" in my pivot chart, so I filtered those out for accuracy.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

Based on the sample size surveyed, campaigns that started in the Summer were more successful and trended downward heading into the Winter season. 

December had the same amount of failures as successes, this could be worth diving into further.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Setting a lower goal was more successful and setting a higher goal resulted in more failed campaigns. For a more successful campaign, set a lower goal.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

The dataset is a sample size, it is not comprehensive. We are also only looking at the theater and plays subcategories within our sample set.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

The correlation between the success of goals and launch dates to find the crossover. Do a more detailed graph for December to see what the variables are for the campaigns that failed and succeeded in December. 

We can also create a chart/graph to identify the potential outliers
